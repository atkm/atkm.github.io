      <description>Results discussed in the &amp;ldquo;Server-side Logic Execution&amp;rdquo; lecture of CMU 15-721 were interesting.&#xA;The main paper is: K. Ramachandra, et al., Froid: Optimization of Imperative Programs in a Relational Database (VLDB, 2017) https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00498&#xA;A subset of UDF can be compiled to SQL. Then standard query optimization routines apply. Decorrelation of user defined function invocations in queries (2014, link) is what the Froid paper is based on. C. Duta, et al., Compiling PL/SQL Away (CIDR, 2020, https://arxiv.</description>

      <title>On-disk structures of write-ahead log (WAL)</title>

      <description>1. How does one store WAL on disk? How do you store WAL on disk? This came up when I was working on a database course assignment on recovery. The assignment closely follows the Database System Concepts textbook.&#xA;The only requirement on the WAL structure is that the LSN can be used to seek to the record on disk. Obviously, we want locality; but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard to acheive, because these records have to be written sequentially.</description>

      <description>Gurobi says their algorithm is based on the paper &amp;ldquo;Identifying Minimally Infeasible Subsystems of Inequalities&amp;rdquo; from 1990.&#xA;This thread from Gurobi has some discussion on how Gurobi does it.&#xA;An article by Chinneck. These slides from Chinneck. &amp;ldquo;Identifying Minimally Infeasible Subsystems of Inequalities&amp;rdquo; By John Gleeson, Jennifer Ryan. 1990.&#xA;Link&#xA;Notes:&#xA;\( y_i := 1 \text{ iff the i^th constraint is deleted.} \) \( S_i := \text{ the set of constraint indices in the j^th IIS.</description>

      <title>Simple properties of IIS</title>

      <description>IIS stands for &amp;ldquo;Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem&amp;rdquo;. There is no Wikipedia entry for it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the definition from a Gurobi article.&#xA;Let \( I_0 \) be a subset of constraints. \( I_0 \) is an IIS iff:&#xA;\( I_0 \) is infeasible. Removing any single constraint (&amp;ldquo;or bound&amp;rdquo;) from \( I_0 \) makes it feasible. (I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought about what the &amp;ldquo;or bound&amp;rdquo; part is doing.)&#xA;Property 1: an IIS does not consist of disjoint infeasible systems Example: the following constraints do not comprise an IIS.</description>

      <description>I came across Data diffs: Algorithms for explaining what changed in a dataset.&#xA;The two papers discussed are: Scorpion by Eugene Wu and Sam Madden. Finds common properties of outlier points. DIFF. SQL implementation of Scorpion and similar. The computated can be distributed. An author of the DIFF paper, Peter Bailis, founded sisudata.com. The comments on HN list some related work:&#xA;Dolt is a company whose product is a version-controlled SQL database.</description>

      <description>Lecture video, and what Terrence Tao has to say about the topic.&#xA;The video is associated with this textbook. I came across the Coursera version of this course around 2013. The data analysis section of this course seems to be motivated by signal processing. The course has some overlap with Stanford&amp;rsquo;s EE263 (linear methods).</description>

      <description>Optimization I&amp;rsquo;m interested in learning mathematical optimization (LP, ILP, convex opt), and stochastic problems of a similar flavor (stochastic control?). Probably for historical reasons, convex optimization is taught in EE, and integer programming is in OR.&#xA;Stanford EE263 Linear Dynamical Systems&#xA;An applied linear algebra course. Interesting content, good problems. &amp;ldquo;Linear methods can solve lots of things&amp;rdquo; is a statement that I often hear but without examples. This course makes that statement concrete.</description>

      <description>Mert Pilanci&#xA;Neural Networks are Convex Regularizers&#xA;Mert Pilanci. Any finite two-layer neural network with ReLU has an equivalent convex problem. Talk at Stanford. An audience member said that you want SDG to converge to a local minumum (for generalization?). That doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound right? A previous result showed that an infinite-width network is convex. This paper on the other hand gives a convex problem that can be implemented and solved. All Local Minima are Global for Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks</description>

      <description>Online resources that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful for learning computer science, especially systems. Last updated on 2019-11-23.&#xA;Systems Beyond CMU 15-213.&#xA;CMU 15-440 (Fall version)&#xA;The textbook (Van Steen &amp;amp; Tanenbaum) is readable. The slides are informative as supplements to corresponding textbook chapters and referenced articles. Lab assignments are done in Go. Tons of debugging concurrency issues. 0. Go warm-up. A simple key-value server. Implement a subset of TCP starting with UDP.</description>

      <description>Geometry In \( \mathbb{R}^n \) where \( n \) is large,&#xA;The volume of the unit ball goes to 0 as the dimension goes to infinity. Most of the volume of a n-ball is concentrated around its boundary. Pick two vectors on the surface of the unit ball independently. The two are orthogonal with high probability. Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: a set of points can be embedded almost isometrically w.r.t. \( L_2 \) into a space of a much lower dimension.</description>

      <description>Model Serving FLIP-23. The document also discusses implementing model training as well as model serving. Two linked documents&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Flink ML Roadmap&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Flink-MS&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;are also worth reading. Boris Lublinsky&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;Serving Machine Learning Models&amp;rdquo;, and talk. Distributed Systems Please Stop Calling Database Systems AP or CP. Kate Matsudaira on distributed systems Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit Martin Kleppmann&amp;rsquo;s book and interview. Use of Formal Methods at Amazon Web Services A tale of two clusters: Mesos and YARN A visual explanation of Raft: link Streaming Systems The Dataflow Model, Apache Beam, and Cloud Dataflow Tyler Akidau&amp;rsquo;s article on the Dataflow model.</description>

      <description>Freely available online resources that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful for learning Statistics, Machine Learning, Distributed Computing, Database Systems, and other CS and SWE topics.&#xA;Statistics and Machine Learning ML Expositions on machine learning that are freely accessible (like the ones on Coursera) tend to sweep theoretical foundation and mathematical rigor under the carpet; these are resources that don&amp;rsquo;t skimp on the hard stuff.&#xA;Stanford CS229 Machine Learning&#xA;One-line summary: the course teaches you how to set up a cost function based on a model and data, and figure out how to optimize it.</description>

      <description>I should come up with a solution that uses optimization instead of doing regression twice.&#xA;Introduction The model we consider is \(Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i\), where \( \epsilon_i \) are uncorrelated, and \( \mathbb{V}(\epsilon_i) \) depends on \( i \). We discuss two solutions to finding estimators of \( \alpha, \beta \). Weighted least squares regression leads to best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE). Also, with stronger assumptions on \( \epsilon_i \), maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) can be found.</description>
